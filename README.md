 CodeGym mini project - level 31 - Custom Tree - data struture
 
 This short project implements special tree implementation. It works in following way: <br>
 1. Nodes are iterated left to right <br>
 2. Size is given in node count (excluding root) <br>
 3. General idea is presented in picture below: <br>

 4. Once element is removed, we block ability to add nodes to given parent until all nodes from given "level" are removed <br>
 5. When things mentioned above are done, we restore ability to add nodes <br>

Task completed. My takeaways: <br>
-> Practice with data structures - Tree, Queue <br>
-> Digging inside methods used on daily basis (remove, add, size, etc) in list-type structures
