 CodeGym mini project - level 31 - Custom Tree - data struture
 
 This short project implements special tree implementation. It works in following way:
 1. Nodes are iterated left to right
 2. Size is given in node count (excluding root)
 3. General idea is presented in picture below:

 4. Once element is removed, we block ability to add nodes to given parent until all nodes from given "level" are removed
 5. When things mentioned above are done, we restore ability to add nodes

Task completed. My takeaways: <br>
-> Practice with data structures - Tree, Queue
-> Digging inside methods used on daily basis (remove, add, size, etc) in list-type structures
